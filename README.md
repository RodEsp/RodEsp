I'm a software developer with a deep passion for open-source software and the art of writing clean, robust code. 

My expertise spans from front-end web development using JavaScript to architecting cloud infrastructure with tools like Kubernetes. My professional journey has been diverse, starting in the close-knit environment of a 6-person startup at the Purdue Research Park and culminating at Salesforce, a global tech powerhouse. This blend of experiences has gifted me a unique perspective, allowing me to approach projects with both a detailed and broad lens.

Beyond the digital realm, I have a profound appreciation for the natural world. Whether it's diving, gymnastics, or any outdoor activity, I cherish the thrill of movement and exploration. Teaching is another passion of mine; had I not ventured into software, I might have been in a classroom, and who knows, maybe that's a path I'll explore in the future.

Community engagement is also close to my heart. I've taught with Girl Develop It, contributed to infrastructure projects with the RRGCC, advocated with the American Alpine Club, and currently, I'm helping NYC Mesh in their mission to provide affordable internet to New Yorkers.
