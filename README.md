👋🏻 Hola, hello, hei, I'm Rodrigo!
-
👦🏻 I'm a software developer with a deep passion for open-source software and the art of writing clean, maintainable, and robust code.

👨🏻‍💻 My expertise spans from front-end web development using JavaScript to architecting DevOps infrastructure with tools like Kubernetes. My professional journey has been diverse, starting in the close-knit environment of a [6-person startup](https://www.foundops.com/) at the Purdue Research Park and culminating at Salesforce, a global tech powerhouse. This blend of experiences has gifted me a unique perspective, allowing me to approach projects with both a detailed and broad lens.

🏔️ Beyond the digital realm, I have a profound appreciation for movement, and the natural world. Whether it's diving, gymnastics, climbing, or any outdoor activity, I cherish the thrill of adventure and exploration.
 
🧑🏻‍🏫 Teaching is another passion of mine; had I not ventured into software, I might have been a teacher. I tutored throughout highschool and taught with [Girl Develop It](https://girldevelopit.com/) for 3 years. Who knows, maybe I'll end up in a classroom yet.

🫂 Community engagement is also close to my heart. I've help build trails and bridges with the [RRGCC](https://rrgcc.org/), advocated for climbers with the [American Alpine Club](https://americanalpineclub.org/), recruited and fundraised for [Surf For Life](https://www.surfforlife.org/), and currently, I'm helping [NYC Mesh](https://www.nycmesh.net/) in their mission to provide affordable internet to New Yorkers.
